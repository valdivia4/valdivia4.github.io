## Projects

#### Automatic Lunge Detection: A Deep Learning Approach

- Combined deep learning knowledge with the domain expertise of Stanford biologists to automate the detection of anomalous whale lunges in time-series data.
- Worked in a two-person team to develop a two-part detection and correction model using feed-forward, recurrent, and ResNet neural network architectures in Keras and TensorFlow.
- Successfully tuned a model to achieve an F1 score of 0.97, closely reaching Bayes error rate on the task, after extensive literature review, data exploration and pre-processing, hyper-parameter searching, and error analysis.

#### Modeling Educational Outcomes with Deep Learning

- Built a model which takes in incomplete covariate data and satellite images for a school district and predicts its performance.
- Combined feed-forward, convolutional, and ResNet-50 models to create an architecture which achieved a 0.629 R2 value.

#### Tumor Segmentation with Convolutional Neural Networks
- Collaborated as a team to experiment with convolutional, UNet, and Mask R-CNN architectures to precisely pinpoint the pixel-wise locations of tumors in mammograms.
- Persevered through numerous setbacks with extensive hyper-parameter tuning, data augmentation, transfer learning, and architecture modifications to achieve a mean AP of 0.08, highlighting the difficulty of the task.

#### Social Network Analysis in Stanford CS
- Developed graph frameworks to understand the social networks within Stanfordâ€™s introductory CS course.
- Implemented Newman's Spectral Algorithm using snap.py and used other community finding algorithms to unveil evidence of the effects of gender, race, community size, and existing academic structures on student performance.

## Extra Fun Project
#### Mia Classifier
- Scraped Google Images for tuxedo cats to prove to my mom that Mia was one-of-a-kind and even a computer program could tell her apart from all others.
- Trained a PyTorch resnet-34 model which was pretrained on ImageNet using two methods: first, by freezing all but the last layers and second, by fine-tuning of the whole network.
- Achieved 99% accuracy in classifying whether an image of a tuxedo cat was Mia or was not Mia on a held-out validation set.
